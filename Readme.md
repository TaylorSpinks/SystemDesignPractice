# Architecture Interview Prep
This is a repo to share my architecture study for tech interviews.

## How this works
I have told the AI what I want to work on, such as AWS cloud architecture. And the topics I want to cover, and it generates a interview like cloud architecture question.
And then I ask it to give me interview like question about the design.

It will then mark based on my answers. However, I have experienced it's trying to be too nice unless ask it not to be.
